Given the following choices in the algorithm screen:

A : My Algorithm
B : Your Algorithm
C : Her Algorithm

You could choose only Your Algorithm by entering B.
You could choose My Algorithm and Her Algorithm by entering AC.
You could choose all three algorithms by entering ABC (in any order), or 
by entering *.

The following is a list of the algorithms and what they do:

Brute Force Algorithm:

The Brute Force algorithm is a naive solution to the TSP.  
It simply calculates every possible route, adds up the cost of the that 
route and picks the lowest cost route.

This is an exact algorithm.

An iteration for this algorithm means that the algorithm checked one complete
path.


Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a greedy algorithm that simply keeps 
picking the next closest node and marking it as visited.  Once all nodes 
have been visited, it adds a trip back to the starting node to the tour 
and is complete.

This is a non-exact algorithm.

An iteration for this algorithm means that the algorithm added one node to it's
path.


Branch and Bound Algorithm (List Based & Tree Based):

The Branch and Bound algorithm keeps extending branches one node at a time until
it becomes apparent that route can not be the shortest route.  For example, say
it already has found a route that is total cost of 100.  If any other routes are
already 100 or greater and not yet finished, there is no way they could be the
shortest branch and shouldn't be considered further.

An iteration for this algorithm means that the algorithm added a path branch.
